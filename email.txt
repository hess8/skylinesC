Convert C2 landscapes to C3, groupflights fixed, password reset fixed, TeamXC servers
Hi $first_name,

Here is the latest:

1. All the C2 landscapes on skylinescondor.com can be flown in Condor3.  See the details below.

2. TeamXC servers are hosting rotating flights that can be found on all the serverslists.  They focus on tasks on a large variety of mountainous landscapes including converted C2 landscapes.

3. The groupflight feature in skylinesCondor is fully working now.  It had a version-change related bug.

4. Password reset emails are working now, so if you forgot your password click the link on the login page.

<b>Using a Condor2 landscape in Condor3</b>
The new "C2C3" downloads contain converted landscapes. The "_to_C3" downloads have the few files needed add to a landscape you already have.
<a href="https://skylinescondor.com/convert">Convert-Landscapes</a> is a tool to help you convert landscapes quickly. It creates the symbolic links needed between all converted C2 landscapes and the C3 Landscapes folder. It also quickly extracts the "_to_C3" downloads and places them in a C2 landscape you already have.
